\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
We presented the coherent architecture train on sufficiently large and diverse data that can give near state-of-the-art results on indoor, outdoor, non-homogenous, dense and synthetic haze environments on qualitative metrics PSNR and SSIM. Our model gives structurally enhanced output on poorly visible input images. We used a combination of loss functions to generate a haze-free image without colour degradation, noise and structural loss. Our method demonstrated by choosing adequate qualitative and quantitative data miniature and straightforward network can effective as the existing methods. In future, our model can be used to get haze-free images for vision tasks such as object detection,  segmentation and human action recognition if needed. Also, we will improve our model on low-light hazy images and colour restoration from densely hazy images.
